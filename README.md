**Table View Drag**

Safari-Like top view animation expand/shrink based on scroll. 

Current example uses a tableView and an UIImage but can very easily be modified to work with any other UIObjects.

You can also enable or disable the snap feature. Makes it snap to the nearest position.

Note: Right now, the UIImageView is aligned with the Superview, not Safe Area, because this way it feels more like a navigation bar. You can easily change that on the storyboard constraints.
